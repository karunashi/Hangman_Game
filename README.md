## Description on how to use APP
This hangman game was made to accept any key inputs. User will have 10 chances each round to guess the word correctly. If they do not guess correctly within 10 tries, it will result in a loss. If the user is able to guess the word, it will result in a win. After reaching 5 wins and/or losses, user will be met with a special event shown on their main screen in the interface. Be sure to note, that you will be notified if you press the same letter twice, and no extra chances on guesses will be lost.

### Be sure to try winning 5 times, or losing 5 times to see a special event play during your adventure!

## Requirements
1. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
2. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
3. Show the following:
 - Guesses left
 - Loss Counter
 - Win Counter
 - Underscores for any missing letters needing to be guessed

##### As long as it works like a Hangman, with keyboard as the main input for keys, it should meet the requirements for the assignment. Theme was encouraged, so it was made with some Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi theme to it.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 - Markup and iFrame
- CSS - Styling
- Bootstrap - Responsive Designing
- JavaScript- Functions, arrays, input, the backend.

## Experience and Thoughts
This was my first JavaScript project with a 1-week accelerated introduction to the concepts. While I was unable to attend the Sunday review session, I was able to watch bits of the clips uploaded, and also ask my peers if I had any questions on what I had missed. It was a very humbling experience, as it felt much more challenging than using HTML and CSS alone for the assignment. While frustrating, I've learned a lot about JavaScript, I've found the entire experience to be very positive as I felt excited to learn many new methods for JavaScript. The assignment also taught me what concepts I was weak in:
- .indexOf()
- .splice()

I was surprised to learn many concepts not covered in class while working on this assignment as well. Topics such as Scope, I had learned while working on the assignment before it was thoroughly covered. I was very happy to learn that I've learned how to work with local and global variables in scopes effectively enough to make a functional Hangman game.
